Had to install flask:
pip install flask

Had to add to path:
path=%path%;C:\Users\proth\AppData\Local\Packages\PythonSoftwareFoundation.Python.3.8_qbz5n2kfra8p0\LocalCache\local-packages\Python38\Scripts

Had to set variable to tell flask what to run:
set flask_app=application.py

Turn on debug mode so it's not necessary to constantly restart flask
set flask_env=development

command to start flask is flask run

All was served up to:
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
